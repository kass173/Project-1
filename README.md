# Introduction
Our presentation will look at the UK Food trends since the turn of the millennium. 

We've used data from the UK government website on food and farming.

After going through all the choices between API's and Datasets we picked the UK household family food datasets. This contained detailed information on UK household purchases include statistics. 

Our aim was to identify food and drink trends as well as finding the underlying information from the data. To draw our food & drink consumption popularity.

## The Dataset
a little background on our data set ......

11 Food Categories

23 Food Groups

169 Major Food Categories

134 Minor Food Categories

40 Columns 338 Rows 7700 cell in total

## Our Methodology

Deciding the Data: We found data from UK Gov websites for Farming and food containing various information related to our area. we narrowed down to look at food trends since the turn of the millennium looking at popularity of food and drink by uk household at various age groups. 

Data Exploration & Cleaning the Data: After going through all the choices between API's and Datasets we picked the UK household family food datasets. This contained detailed information on UK household purchases include statistics. 

Initial data exploration was done to better understand and visually identify anomalies within the data as well as focus our research to which area's we wished to explore. When this process concluded we decided on our data set's but instead of picking one data set we have pooled various data sets together to which we created our data frame rather than take an already construct and available one.

And Finally ….The we split the questions amongst the group and produced the relevant code, visuals and conclusions

## Exploration and Data Cleaning
We found our data on “https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/family-food-datasets“, a reputable government source for data on food and farming. The data set comprises 30 columns, detailing text and numerical information on over xxxx food catagories registered since 2000's. Information was given about the xxxxxx, and many statistics about xxxx and so on. Some of this data would be different for different kinds of xxxx, xxxxa.

## Data Cleaning Tasks

## Let’s Talk Tomatoes

Here we are looking at a popular UK ‘vegetable’, we can see the trends appearing between age groups from 2001 and 2019

## Let’s Talk about Bread

Notice the downward trend for the consumption of White bread from 2001 until 2019 for all age groups.
Brown Bread has a less dramatic increase, but is nonetheless decreasing, indicating an overall bread consumption decrease.

##Where’s all the Bread going?
This represents all bread products consumed within the UK, under the two categories White Bread and Brown Bread, according to DEFRA, all bread types can be sorted into these two categories.

Age Groups 65-74 and 75 and Over have eaten nearly 47% of all the bread consumed within the UK from 2001 and 2019. 
That’s a lot of bread!

## The Coffee Problem

That’s a near perfect correlation!
As years go on the UK coffee needs are increasing at a steady rate. 
Does the UK have a coffee problem?

(The answer is yes)

## How about Meat?

This graph represents the total amount consumed per age group, as you can see we see a slight upwards trend with age, until you reach 75 and over, in which we notice a decline.

## Conclusions

We set out to identify food trends in the UK since the turn of the millennia. With the current cost of living crisis, we thought it a poignant time to look into this information to see how our nation’s eating habits have already changed. 

1. What we have found, as a general rule of thumb, is that fresh produce consumption falls during recessions. 

2. We also found that baby milk usage is on the rise. We are not sure if this is down to environmental factors, nor are we sure if this will continue to climb given the cost of living crisis. 

3. Bread, a staple of most people’s standard diet is  decreasing, across all ages! Is this the fall of bread?

4. The UK has a coffee addiction and it seems to be getting worse. 

5. Age Group 65-74 drink the most wine and eat the most meat. This really surprised us, it seems this takes a steep downturn at 75 and over.
